# rusty-otp
A project for my security module where the goal is to learn how Hmac based one time passwords work and to make an implementation of a hotp generator/verifier.

Please Note: The Program looks significantly nicer on linux and does not spam the terminal as bourne shells accept escape codes for cursor control and coloring.
Please Note: This is a command line application, as such it must be ran from a terminal. On Windows use CMD.

The compiled binary for linux is: [HERE](rusty-otp) 

The compiled binary for windows is: [HERE](rusty-otp.exe)
